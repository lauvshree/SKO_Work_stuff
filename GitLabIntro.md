3. Once this process goes through you should be added to be added to the DB0201EN (SQL for Data Science) course project on the IBMSkillsNetwork.

4. Verify the same by going to this [link](https://gitlab.com/ibm/skills-network/courses) and under the listed `Subgroups and Projects` choose `DB0201EN - SQL for Data Science`

5. If you don't see any `Subgroups and Projects`, you are in all probabilities not added as an author in the skills network. Please repeat step 2 and/or follow-up with IBM.

6. Once you can see the contents of the project `DB0201EN - SQL for Data Science`, you can now work on it. 

7. There are two ways to work on the project. 
    a. You can choose to fork the repository. This will create your own mirror image of the repository.
